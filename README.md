# Titanic-Survival-Rate
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover the key factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragedy. Using Excel for data cleaning, validation, and visualization, the analysis provides clear insights on how demographics and travel conditions impacted survival outcomes.

## Database & Problem statment
The dataset used for this project is private and cannot be shared. However, I have included a clear breakdown of the data features and the analysis steps to ensure the project can still be easily understood and followed.
The Titanic was a British luxury passenger 1,309 liner that tragically sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic. With more than  passengers and crew onboard, only about one-quarter of them survived. Understanding who survived and why has remained an important question in historical and data research.

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover the key factors that influenced survival. By transforming unstructured data into meaningful insights, my goal is to answer critical questions about passenger survival patterns and provide a deeper look into the circumstances that determined who made it out alive.

### Overview Analysis
The Titanic dataset initially contained unclean and unstructured information. Using Excel Power Query, I cleaned, validated, and transformed the data to explore key insights related to survival patterns. The analysis focused on variables such as age, gender, passenger class, embarkment port, fare, age groups, and family presence onboard.

Removed duplicate records
Converted the dataset into a structured Excel table
Categorized passenger class from numeric values (1, 2, 3) into
First Class, Second Class, Third Class
Cleaned survival status by converting 1 = Survived and 0 = Did Not Survive
handled missing ages by replacing them with the average age
Created a family indicator 1 = With Family, 0 = No Family Onboard Removed irrelevant fields such as Boat and Home Destination as they did not contribute to the analysis
After cleaning, pivot tables were used to extract insights, especially around historical expectations such as women and children first. i than created a visualization dashboard to clearly show how different factors impacted survival outcomes on the Titanic.
#### Insights
The analysis revealed several important survival patterns Women and children were prioritized during evacuation, leading to a much higher survival rate among females (25%) compared to males (12%).Passenger class played a major role in survival outcomes. First-class passengers had the highest survival rateThird-class passengers experienced the lowest chances of 
Passengers from Southampton had the highest number of survivors Followed by Cherbourg Queenstown passengers had the lowest survival rate Younger passengers children and youth survived at a higher rate than older or senior passengers, who struggled due to physical limitations and the harsh cold conditions. Passengers with larger families onboard had a lower survival rate, likely due to challenges in staying together and ensuring everyone reached lifeboats
#### KPI's
500 Survivers
809 non survivers
avarage price for fare
$87.51 first class
$21,16 sec class
$13.30 third class
